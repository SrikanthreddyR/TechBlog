2. We will go with the basic installation of SQL server which avoids going through multiple cofiguration steps maually. You can follow the steps mentioned in [www.c-sharpcorner.com](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/how-to-install-sql-server-2019/) website to proceed with the installation
3. After installing both SQL Server and SSMS(Tool to connect to the SQL Server), we are good to proceed further.
