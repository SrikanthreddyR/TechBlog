If your system is not running with windows 10, SQL Server 2019 Developer Edition is not compatible for your system. In that case you can download SQL Server 2017 Developer edition using this link [Download SQL Server 2017 Developer edition](https://download.microsoft.com/download/5/A/7/5A7065A2-C81C-4A31-9972-8A31AC9388C1/SQLServer2017-SSEI-Dev.exe)

2. Basic SQL commands. [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_syntax.asp) should be a good starting point if you dont have prior SQL hand on.
