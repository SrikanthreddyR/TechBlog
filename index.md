## Covid 19 Data Analysis

#### Project Overview
1. Loading Covid 19 data into SQL Server Database
2. Data Exloration
3. Data Cleaning
4. Visualization
5. Creating Dashboard
<br/>

#### Prerequisites:
- Should have SQL Server and SSMS installed on your machine. 
     
     - If not, please follow the isntallation process with the video [SQL Server 2019 Developer Edition - Download and Installation Steps
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UdmrVIBzN4) on youtube.
     - Otherwise you can navigate through the installation on [www.c-sharpcorner.com](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/how-to-install-sql-server-2019/) web page to install the same. This link  guides through the basic installation of SQL server which avoids going through multiple cofiguration steps maually.
     - If your system is not running with Windows 10 / Windows Server 2016 or greater, SQL Server 2019 Developer Edition isn't compatible for your machine.
     - In that case you can [Download SQL Server 2017 Developer edition](https://download.microsoft.com/download/5/A/7/5A7065A2-C81C-4A31-9972-8A31AC9388C1/SQLServer2017-SSEI-Dev.exe) using the link and follow the same steps as mentioned in [www.c-sharpcorner.com](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/how-to-install-sql-server-2019/) or [SQL Server 2019 Developer Edition - Download and Installation Steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UdmrVIBzN4).
     - After installing both SQL Server and SSMS(Tool to connect to the SQL Server), we are good to proceed further.

- Basic SQL commands. [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_syntax.asp) should be a good starting point if you don't have prior SQL hands on.
